Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.

It differs from\n * ordinary Fortuna in a few ways, though.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * Most importantly, it has an entropy estimator.  This is present because\n * there is a strong conflict here between making the generator available\n * as soon as possible, and making sure that it doesn't \"run on empty\".\n * In Fortuna, there is a saved state file, and the system is likely to have\n * time to warm up.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * Second, because users are unlikely to stay on the page for very long,\n * and to speed startup time, the number of pools increases logarithmically:\n * a new pool is created when the previous one is actually used for a reseed.\n * This gives the same asymptotic guarantees as Fortuna, but gives more\n * entropy to early reseeds.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * The entire mechanism here feels pretty klunky.  Furthermore, there are\n * several improvements that should be made, including support for\n * dedicated cryptographic functions that may be present in some browsers;\n * state files in local storage; cookies containing randomness; etc.  So\n * look for improvements in future versions.\n * </p>\n * @constructor\n */\nsjcl.prng = function(defaultParanoia) {\n  \n  /* private */\n  this._pools                   = [new sjcl.hash.sha256()];\n  this._poolEntropy             = [0];\n  this._reseedCount             = 0;\n  this._robins                  = {};\n  this._eventId                 = 0;\n  \n  this._collectorIds            = {};\n  this._collectorIdNext         = 0;\n  \n  this._strength                = 0;\n  this._poolStrength            = 0;\n  this._nextReseed              = 0;\n  this._key                     = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];\n  this._counter                 = [0,0,0,0];\n  this._cipher                  = undefined;\n  this._defaultParanoia         = defaultParanoia;\n  \n  /* event listener stuff */\n  this._collectorsStarted       = false;\n  this._callbacks               = {progress: {}, seeded: {}};\n  this._callbackI               = 0;\n  \n  /* constants */\n  this._NOT_READY               = 0;\n  this._READY                   = 1;\n  this._REQUIRES_RESEED         = 2;\n\n  this._MAX_WORDS_PER_BURST     = 65536;\n  this._PARANOIA_LEVELS         = [0,48,64,96,128,192,256,384,512,768,1024];\n  this._MILLISECONDS_PER_RESEED = 30000;\n  this._BITS_PER_RESEED         = 80;\n};\n \nsjcl.prng.prototype = {\n  /** Generate several random words, and return them in an array.\n   * A word consists of 32 bits (4 bytes)\n   * @param {Number} nwords The number of words to generate.\n   */\n  randomWords: function (nwords, paranoia) {\n    var out = [], i, readiness = this.isReady(paranoia), g;\n  \n    if (readiness === this._NOT_READY) {\n      throw new sjcl.exception.notReady(\"generator isn't seeded\");\n    } else if (readiness & this._REQUIRES_RESEED) {\n      this._reseedFromPools(!(readiness & this._READY));\n    }\n  \n    for (i=0; i<nwords; i+= 4) {\n      if ((i+1) % this._MAX_WORDS_PER_BURST === 0) {\n        this._gate();\n      }\n   \n      g = this._gen4words();\n      out.push(g[0],g[1],g[2],g[3]);\n    }\n    this._gate();\n  \n    return out.slice(0,nwords);\n  },\n  \n  setDefaultParanoia: function (paranoia, allowZeroParanoia) {\n    if (paranoia === 0 && allowZeroParanoia !== \"Setting paranoia=0 will ruin your security; use it only for testing\") {\n      throw new sjcl.exception.invalid(\"Setting paranoia=0 will ruin your security; use it only for testing\");\n    }\n\n    this._defaultParanoia = paranoia;\n  },\n  \n  /**\n   * Add entropy to the pools.\n   * @param data The entropic value.
